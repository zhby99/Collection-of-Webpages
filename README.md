### Information Form for the Dating Website
This Webpage is implemented in html and css, which is a very fundamention form webpage used to submit the information of users to the server. The backend of the web is simply showing the information of the users, which is not implemented by me, see http://ihome.ust.hk/~rossiter/cgi-bin/show_everything.php.

### Guess Color Game
This single page game is a practice of fundamental javascript knowledge. There will be a random color in the color array and your task is to guess it according to the hints.

### Face Matching Game
This single page game is about finding the extra face, which is also a practice of html and javascript. The knowledge of event listener and DOM is applied.

### conFusion
This is a practice webpage about practice on Bootstrap. Including the Bootstrap grid system and response website.
